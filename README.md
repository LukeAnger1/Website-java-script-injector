# Website-java-script-injector
This script is a google extension that is designed to inject code into javascript code that is ran on websites. 

Download nodejs and the needed packages, if I have time I will make a script to do this but I am lazy so probaly not going to happen

Run the server with the command below
# node server.js

Add unpacked extension to chrome, google this visuals help and I dont care enough to insert pictures
